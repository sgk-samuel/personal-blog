ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my world!

Hey, I am Samuel, a front-end development engineer.

Working at  NuxtLabs.<br />
Creator of Vitest, Slidev, VueUse, UnoCSS, Elk, Type Challenges and others.
Core team member of Vue, Nuxt and Vite.

Dreaming up ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies. You can find my full projects list here. I also do some generative-art, compform, interactivity experiments on 100.antfu.me.

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing photography and traveling. Some of my photos can be found on Instagram. If you happen to be in the same city I live (currently in Paris), maybe we can hang out and take some photos or code together.
